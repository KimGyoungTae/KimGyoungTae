## About me

### âš¡ Currently Main Interest:
- I'm interested in how **space sharing** with XR and 3D reconstruction can lead to **shared experiences between users**, with examples like [Meta's Hyperscape](https://www.meta.com/ko-kr/experiences/meta-horizon-hyperscape-demo/7972066712871980/?srsltid=AfmBOooi7JDpSSddr6U94_Zmazvd2xxnEr8OtL2u3O24_FpXAHzZxk72).
- Iâ€™m also curious about the potential that this technology could fulfill the desire for memory recall.
